# README

This repository contains the sources for https://projects.rzeszutek.ca.  The
site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and deployed on the
`deployment` branch.

> Note: Building the site requires Node.js 20.x LTS.

To build the site:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies with `$ npm ci`.
3. Run either:
    * `npm run build` to build the site in "production" mode.
    * `npm run serve` to start up the Eleventy server for local hosting.
